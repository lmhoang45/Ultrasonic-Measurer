# Ultrasonic-Measurer
The project proposed a design to measure human body height and weight through a non-contact approach using ultrasonic sensor 
SRF04. The two microcontrollers used are Arduino Uno R3. The first one is to measure the body's height and is programmed with code slave.io. The other is for width and frontage measurement and other main operations, programmed by master.io. The project's paper is also uploaded in the repo.  
The paper was published in an international conference on biomedical engineering held in Vietnam in June 2018, whose proceedings would be published by Springer in its "IFMBE" series.
